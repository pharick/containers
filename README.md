# containers

**Implementation of some standard containers from the C++ STL library. A project completed at Ecole42.**

## Key Features

- Implemented containers:
  - list (doubly-linked list)
  - vector (dynamically resizing array)
  - map (key-value pair storage built on a red-black tree)
  - set (set)
  - stack (stack)
- Iterators are implemented for the list, vector, and map containers.

## Build and Run Tests
